What information about a stock "could be useful"

- Exchange where a stock is traded
- Comparison of stock with broad based market index (CNX 500 and NIFTY say)
- If stock is part of any indices - it's performance with respect to those indices
- Ownership of stock by mutual fund (good to have would be an indication of up or down)
- Liquidity (3 month average volume as a percentile)
- Chart (of course) going back max up to 10 years.
- Dividends/splits etc (on chart)
- Returns based "score" - (percentile score) compared to all returns. for 1m/1w/3m/1y/ytd
